Discreet Launcher provides you a distraction-free home screen, allowing you to fully enjoy your wallpaper (only the status and navigation bars have been kept for convenience).<br/><br/>
From this clean home screen, simply slide your finger down to display your favorites applications or up to see the complete list of applications.<br/><br/>
Holding your finger on an application, you can access its system settings. It is also possible to make the status bar fully transparent, to display a clock on the home screen and to use an icon pack.<br/><br/>
Discreet Launcher is open source, doesn't require any unnecessary permission, works completely offline and doesn't include any advertisements.
